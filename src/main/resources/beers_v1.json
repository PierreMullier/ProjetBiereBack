In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\r\n\r\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass."},

In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel."},

This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\r\n\r\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\r\n\r\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head."},

Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness."},

No one is certain how or why they were built, but many have speculated on their origin, purpose and the people who built them.  \r\n\r\nWe invite you to develop your own theories on the legend and mystery of Tyranena while enjoying a Stone Tepee Pale Ale.\r\n\r\n Stone Tepee Pale Ale is brewed in the tradition of an American pale ale.  This beer celebrates the American hop, with its characteristic bitterness, flavor and aroma."},

The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation.

Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never settle\u00e2\u20ac\u009d philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monument to hops.\r\n\r\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\r\n\r\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award.

In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\r\n\r\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIBU 95\r\n\r\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto: chris mather\r\nRatings, Awards & Notables\r\n\r\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\r\n2007 World Beer Awards\r\n\r\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\r\n2006 International Beer Challenge\r\n\r\nGold Medal, 92 Points\r\n2006 World Beer Championships\r\n\r\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\r\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\r\n\r\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\r\n5 out 5 stars \r\nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Imperial IPA\u00e2\u20ac\u009d status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This one is lovely,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said taster Tom Conti. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They got it just right.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d one taster observed.\r\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\r\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a beautiful beer,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d concluded taster Gregg Glaser. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Full of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not for the timid,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said taster Robert Lachman.\r\n\r\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/125352.aspx"},

They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor.

Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.\r\nThis yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.\r\n\r\nHarpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wet\u00e2\u20ac\u009d hops."},
