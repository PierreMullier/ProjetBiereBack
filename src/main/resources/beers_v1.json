 {"idBiere":4422, "nom":"Hoegaarden", "cat":11, "style":116, "degre":4.9, "description":"Hoegaarden is the authentic Belgian wheat or white beer. It has a unique and extremely complex brewing process whereby the brand is first top fermented and then is refermented within the bottle - ending up in a unique cloudy-white appearance. The brand's unique appearance is mirrored by its one-of-a-kind taste - sweet and sour beer with a little bitterness, slightly spicy, with a strong touch of coriander and a hint of orange, perfect for warm summer days, instead of other refreshing beverages. Refreshing, a little quirky, and decidedly different - naturally."},

These characteristics derive not only from the grains used but also from restrained hopping with Styrians and the fruity nature (banana and vanilla) of the house yeast.\r\n\r\nSMELL:\r\nVery refined and complex. Hints of vanilla mixed with citrus aromas.\r\n\r\nTASTE:\r\nTripel Karmeliet has not only the lightness and freshness of wheat, but also the creaminess of oats together with a spicy lemony almost quinine\r\ndryness."},

There is no acidity, but an after-bitterness which melts in the mouth.\r\n\r\nThis top fermented Trappist beer, refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised."},
